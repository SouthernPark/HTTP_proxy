# CONNECT
Before using multi process / multo threads, the CONNECT request will stop and block there.  
The reason for that is after CONNECT, the website will usually send GET or POST request by  
the JavaScript to get resources to render the html.  

The issue is that CONNECT will use select to monitor between client and server. This operation
will block until there is one sock active.  When there is another GET/POST request after CONNECT,
the GET/POST will not get answered causing the page to shut down.

Therefore, before testing the CONNECT, we have to finish the multi process.

# Unauthenticated Connection
The http-proxy does not authenticate the incoming request, which means every person can send request
to our proxy and our proxy will handle the request for them.

But some mallicious user may send too many requests to the proxy to prevent other users to access the proxy.

# Exception
The exception guarantee is basic. 
I use unique_ptr when I want to use memo in the heap, when there is a exception thrwos, the stack will be 
unwinded and the heap memo in will be freed because the unique_ptr will be unwind from stack.

The use of unique_ptr ensures that I will not have dangling pointers.
Therefore, the exception guarantee is basic.
